# 🧩 Git Merge vs Git Rebase:

Imagine you're working on a school project with your friends. You all have your own notebooks (branches), and you're writing your parts separately. Now you want to combine everyone's work into one notebook. Git Merge and Git Rebase are two ways to do that.

## 🟢 Git Merge: Integrates changes by creating a new merge commit, preserving the history of both branches. “Let’s tape our notebooks together”

- You and your friend wrote different parts of a story.
- You **merge** them by taping your pages together.
- You can still see who wrote what and when.
- It creates a **“merge commit”** that says: “We combined our work here!”

**Pros:**
- Keeps full history.
- Easy to see who did what.

**Cons:**
- History can look messy with lots of branches.

## 🔵 Git Rebase: “Let’s copy your work into my notebook”

- Instead of taping, you **rebase** by copying your friend’s pages into your notebook as if you wrote them first.
- Your notebook looks like one clean story.
- It rewrites history to make it look like you started after your friend.

**Pros:**
- Clean, straight history.
- Easier to read.

**Cons:**
- Can be risky if you’re working with others (rewriting history).

## 💡 Summary

If you’re working with a team, use **merge** to keep everyone’s work visible.  
If you want a clean notebook just for yourself, **rebase** is great.
